# Scholarship-Matcher

Scholarship-Matcher is a website made with HMTL, CSS and JavaScript which allows students to choose critera which is suited for them, and then recieve recomendations of scholarships which fit into that criteria. A pre-made JSON file is written to showcase how the the website will work, and will subsequently have real scholarships written using a webscraper. This website also uses the CountryLayer API to provide real-time country data with autocomplete functionality for the country selection field. 

I made this project as I wanted to make the process of looking for scholarships more streamlined and effiecent. This website offers eliminates the need to manually search for opportunities and scholarships (and in doing so wasting precious time), and in turn helps students focus on scholarships where they have the best chance of success.
